\usage{
save_wav(
  x,
  file,
  amplitude = 0.1,
  bit_depth = 16L,
  length_sec = 1,
  fade_length = 0.1,
  rise_length = 0.1,
  end_pad = 0.05,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object to save; currently only individual chords are supported.
Chords are coerced to a \code{\link{wave}} representation.}

\item{file}{(Character scalar) Output file.}

\item{amplitude}{(Numeric scalar)
The wave is multiplied by this number before exporting.
The resulting wave should fall completely within the range [-1, 1].}

\item{bit_depth}{(Integer scalar)
The bit depth of the exported audio.}

\item{length_sec}{(Numeric scalar) Length of the output wave, in seconds.}

\item{fade_length}{(Numeric scalar)
Chord fade-out time (seconds).}

\item{rise_length}{(Numeric scalar)
Chord fade-in time (seconds).}

\item{end_pad}{(Numeric scalar)
Duration of silence (seconds) appended to the end of the audio file,
used to avoid clicks and other artifacts.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=expand_harmonics]{expand_harmonics}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{num_harmonics}}{(Integerish scalar)
Number of harmonics (including the fundamental) to which
each tone should be expanded.}
    \item{\code{roll_off_dB}}{(Numeric scalar) Parametrises the amount of amplitude roll-off
in the harmonics, with greater values corresponding to higher roll-off.}
    \item{\code{digits}}{Number of digits to which each partial's MIDI pitch should be rounded.}
    \item{\code{label_harmonics}}{If TRUE, then the harmonics in the resulting spectrum are labelled with their harmonic numbers.}
    \item{\code{octave_ratio}}{The octave ratio for stretching and compressing harmonics, defaults to 2.0.}
    \item{\code{coherent}}{Whether the amplitudes from different spectral components should be combined
assuming coherent summation, where the amplitudes simply add together
(default is \code{FALSE}).
Otherwise incoherent summation is used, where the amplitudes are squared, added, then
square rooted.}
