  x,
  ...,
  sigma = 6.83,
  num_harmonics = 11L,
  roll_off_dB = 1,
  coherent = FALSE

\arguments{
\item{x}{Object to convert. By default \code{\link{sparse_pc_spectrum}}
is called first to convert the object to a sparse pitch-class spectrum.}

\item{...}{Provided for S3 method consistency.}

\item{sigma}{(Numeric scalar)
Standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution used to simulate
perceptual blurring. Defaults to 6.83 cents, after
\insertCite{Milne2016;textual}{hrep}.}

\item{num_harmonics}{(Integerish scalar)
Number of harmonics (including the fundamental) to which
each tone should be expanded.}

\item{roll_off_dB}{(Numeric scalar) Parametrises the amount of amplitude roll-off
in the harmonics, with greater values corresponding to higher roll-off.}

\item{coherent}{Whether the amplitudes from different spectral components should be combined
assuming coherent summation, where the amplitudes simply add together
(default is \code{FALSE}).
Otherwise incoherent summation is used, where the amplitudes are squared, added, then
square rooted.}

\description{
Creates an object of class \code{smooth_pc_spectrum},
describing a smooth pitch-class spectrum.
A smooth pitch-class spectrum describes perceptual weight
along a continuous pitch class scale.
The representation incorporates smoothing to account for
imprecisions in pitch perception.
}
\details{
This representation is created by expressing the sonority
as a sparse pitch-class spectrum (see \code{\link{sparse_pc_spectrum}})
and convolving the result with a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation
\code{sigma}.

\seealso{
This representation was inspired by \code{\link{milne_pc_spectrum}},
which embodies similar ideas with a slightly different implementation.
See \code{\link{smooth_pi_spectrum}} for an equivalent representation
in the pitch domain.
