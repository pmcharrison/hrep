\details{
A sparse pitch spectrum describes an input sonority as a finite set
of spectral components, each defined by a
pitch (expressed on the MIDI pitch scale)
and an amplitude (expressed in arbitrary units, but with the
fundamental frequencies of chord pitches typically taking the value 1).

A sparse pitch spectrum is most easily created by coercion from
a different chord representation. If a numeric vector is provided as the input,
it is treated as a \code{pi_chord} representation, for example
\code{sparse_pi_spectrum(c(60, 64, 67))} will create a sparse pitch spectrum
by expanding the harmonics implied by a C major triad.

A sparse pitch spectrum can also be created directly by providing a list
with two elements, the first being labelled "pitch", and the second labelled "amplitude",
each of which being numeric vectors of the same length.
In this case no harmonic expansion is performed.
The first element will be taken as a vector of pitches,
and the second element will be taken as a vector of corresponding amplitudes.
For example, one might write
\code{sparse_pi_spectrum(list(pitch = c(60, 72, 79), amplitude = c(3, 2, 1)))}.
